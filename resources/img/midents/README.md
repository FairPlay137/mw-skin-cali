These are very early WIP asset files for the upcoming "Midents" extension (pronounced "my-dents"). The Midents extension will be a SocialProfile-reliant extension that allows users to create a character representation of themselves for use in place of avatars if a custom one hasn't been uploaded yet.
The Cali skin will be the first skin to have special support for Midents, hence why these files are even in here in the first place.

To Do:
* Once the first assets are complete, begin work on the extension itself. (Will be revealed later on)
* Move all the Midents-related assets to the Midents extension.
